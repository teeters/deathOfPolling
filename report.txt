About this design:

Since this article talks about the process of statistical sampling and its
power and limitations, I thought it would be a good idea to visualize the
sampling process. I wrote a function called draw_sample which takes in data
about a population broken down by party affiliation, race, and gender
(visualized as color bars, icons, and icon colors), and draws a representation
of the population scaled to fit the user's screen. Like-colored icons are grouped
together to improve visual scanning speed.

Positioning:

I decided to put the visualizations in a vertical column to the right of the
article to convey a timeline-like effect. I use simple, bold arrows to indicate
drawing a sample from a larger population. When the article discusses the fluctuating
polls prior to the election, I create a series of samples showing how dramatic
the change is.

About the data:

I did my best to make my representations of the US population as accurate as possible.
All of my demographics come from real data compiled by the Pew research center
(see code comments for a link). My samples accurately show the demographic breakdown
of each party. Their only inaccuracy is that they do not correlate icon shape with icon
color. If the Republicans are 60% male, for example, the model assumes that this ratio
is true for both black Republicans and white Republicans and draws icons accordingly.
In reality, most female Republicans are white. Luckily, this discrepancy should only
be noticeable at much larger sample sizes than the model generates.

For the best effect, view the visualization page in Chrome in a large window.
